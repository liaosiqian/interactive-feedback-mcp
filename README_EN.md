# Interactive Feedback MCP

A powerful [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that enables seamless human-in-the-loop workflows in AI-assisted development tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com). This server allows you to run commands, view their output, and provide rich textual feedback directly to the AI with an intuitive graphical interface.

## üí° Why Use This?

By guiding the assistant to check in with the user instead of branching out into speculative, high-cost tool calls, this module can drastically reduce the number of premium requests (e.g., OpenAI tool invocations) on platforms like Cursor. In some cases, it helps consolidate what would be up to 25 tool calls into a single, feedback-aware request ‚Äî saving resources and improving performance.

### Performance Benefits
- **Reduced API costs** by minimizing unnecessary tool calls
- **Improved accuracy** through human validation at key decision points
- **Enhanced productivity** with streamlined feedback workflows
- **Better collaboration** between AI and human developers

## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Workflow
1. **Launch the interface** when called by your AI assistant
2. **Review the summary** of what the AI has accomplished
3. **Use quick response buttons** for common feedback scenarios:
   - ‚úÖ **Looks Good** - Approve the current work
   - üîß **Needs Adjustment** - Request minor modifications
   - üìã **Complete All Checklist** - Execute remaining tasks
   - üéØ **Smart Execute Checklist** - Intelligently process remaining items

### Advanced Features

#### üîç RIPER-5 Protocol Workflow
The system includes specialized buttons for systematic problem-solving:
- **üîç Analyze Problem** - Deep analysis mode with systematic breakdown
- **üí° Find Solutions** - Brainstorm multiple approaches and evaluate options
- **üìã Create Plan** - Generate detailed implementation plans with review checkpoints
- **‚ö° Execute Steps** - Follow the plan with interactive feedback
- **üéØ Verify Results** - Comprehensive verification against requirements

#### üñºÔ∏è Image Integration
1. **Drag images** directly into the interface or use Ctrl+V to paste screenshots
2. **Configure transmission options** - Enable Base64 for AI recognition
3. **Adjust compression settings** - Choose target sizes for optimal performance
4. **Review images** before sending with thumbnail previews

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options
1. **Edit Quick Buttons** - Click the ‚öôÔ∏è button to customize responses
2. **Tool Menu** - Access system functions like temporary file cleanup
3. **Language Switching** - Toggle between English and Chinese interfaces
4. **Layout Preferences** - Adjust button sizes and window layout

### Command Execution Features
- **Toggle Command Section** - Show/hide the command execution panel
- **Auto-execution Mode** - Enable automatic command running on startup
- **Real-time Output** - View command results as they execute
- **Process Control** - Start, stop, and monitor running processes

## üìã Prompt Engineering

For the best results, add the following to your custom prompt in your AI assistant:

```
Whenever you want to ask a question, always call the MCP `interactive_feedback`.  
Whenever you're about to complete a user request, call the MCP `interactive_feedback` instead of simply ending the process.
Keep calling MCP until the user's feedback is empty, then end the request.

When using RIPER-5 protocol buttons, follow the systematic approach:
1. üîç RESEARCH: Analyze problems thoroughly before proposing solutions
2. üí° INNOVATE: Explore multiple creative approaches  
3. üìã PLAN: Create detailed, reviewable implementation plans
4. ‚ö° EXECUTE: Follow plans step-by-step with checkpoints
5. üéØ REVIEW: Verify results against original requirements
```

This ensures your AI assistant uses the MCP server effectively and follows structured problem-solving approaches.

## üîß Configuration

This MCP server uses Qt's `QSettings` to store configuration on a per-project basis, including:

### Stored Settings
- **Command preferences** - Default commands for each project
- **Execution settings** - Auto-execution preferences and command history
- **UI preferences** - Window geometry, button visibility, language selection
- **Quick response customization** - Custom buttons, sizes, and arrangements
- **Image handling settings** - Compression preferences and transmission options
- **Performance settings** - Layout caching and update preferences

### Storage Locations
Settings are stored in platform-specific locations:
- **Windows**: Registry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\InteractiveFeedbackMCP\InteractiveFeedbackMCP`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Preferences/com.InteractiveFeedbackMCP.InteractiveFeedbackMCP.plist`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/InteractiveFeedbackMCP/InteractiveFeedbackMCP.conf`

### Configuration Structure
- **Global Settings**: General UI settings like window geometry and language preferences are stored in the `MainWindow_General` group
- **Project-Specific Settings**: Each project gets a unique configuration group based on its directory path hash, formatted as `Project_{ProjectName}_{DirectoryHash}`
- **Base Transmission Settings**: Global feature settings like Base64 transmission configuration are stored at the root level

### Configuration Isolation Mechanism
The system ensures different projects' configurations don't interfere with each other through:
1. **Directory Hashing**: Uses MD5 hash of the project directory to generate unique identifiers
2. **Group Separation**: Different projects' settings are stored in independent configuration groups
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Project-specific settings take priority, with global defaults used when not set

### Specific Configuration Items
Each project configuration group contains the following settings:
- `run_command`: Default execution command for the project
- `execute_automatically`: Whether to automatically execute commands
- `suffix_mode`: Feedback suffix mode (force/smart/none)
- `button_size`: Button size setting (small/medium/large/custom)
- `custom_button_width/height`: Custom button dimensions
- `visible_buttons`: List of visible quick response buttons
- `language`: Interface language setting
- `use_base64_transmission`: Whether to enable Base64 image transmission
- `base64_target_size_kb`: Target file size for Base64 transmission
- `commandSectionVisible`: Whether command section is visible
- `quick_responses`: Custom quick response button configuration

### Configuration File Example
On Linux systems, the configuration file content looks like:
```ini
[MainWindow_General]
geometry=@ByteArray(...)
windowState=@ByteArray(...)

[Project_MyProject_a1b2c3d4]
run_command=python main.py
execute_automatically=false
suffix_mode=force
button_size=medium
language=zh_CN
use_base64_transmission=true
base64_target_size_kb=30
```
